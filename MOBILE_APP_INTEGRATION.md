## Code Reuse Strategy

### Shared Components
- **Types**: Opportunity, User, and SearchFilters interfaces
- **API Endpoints**: Same backend APIs for both web and mobile
- **Business Logic**: Search, filtering, and interest registration
- **Utilities**: Date formatting, validation, and data processing

### Mobile-Specific Adaptations
- **Navigation**: React Navigation with bottom tabs and stack navigation
- **UI Components**: React Native components with touch-optimized design
- **Storage**: AsyncStorage for local data persistence
- **Platform Integration**: Native phone, email, and sharing capabilities

## Key Features

### Student Authentication
- Secure login with token-based authentication
- Persistent session management
- Automatic token refresh

### Opportunities Browse
- Mobile-optimized opportunity cards
- Pull-to-refresh functionality
- Infinite scroll for large datasets
- Search and filter capabilities

### Interest Management
- One-tap interest registration/removal
- Visual feedback for interest status
- Offline capability with sync

### Opportunity Details
- Comprehensive opportunity information
- Contact integration (email, phone)
- Native sharing functionality
- Deadline alerts and reminders

### Profile Management
- User profile display
- Activity tracking
- Settings and preferences

## API Integration

The mobile app connects to the same backend APIs:

```typescript
// Opportunities
GET /api/opportunities/search
POST /api/opportunities/:id/register
DELETE /api/opportunities/:id/unregister

// Authentication
POST /api/auth/login
GET /api/auth/current-user
POST /api/auth/logout

// User Profile
GET /api/users/:id
PUT /api/users/:id
```

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. Node.js 16 or later
2. npm or yarn
3. Expo CLI
4. Expo Go app on mobile device

### Installation
1. Navigate to mobile directory: `cd mobile`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Update API URL in `src/services/api.ts`
4. Start development server: `npm start`
5. Scan QR code with Expo Go app

### Configuration
Update the API base URL in `mobile/src/services/api.ts`:
```typescript
const API_BASE_URL = 'https://your-backend-url.com';
```

## Development Guidelines

### State Management
- React Query for server state and caching
- React Context for global app state
- Local component state for UI state

### Navigation Structure
```
App
├── Auth Stack
│   └── Login Screen
└── Main Tabs
    ├── Opportunities Stack
    │   ├── Opportunities List
    │   └── Opportunity Detail
    └── Profile Screen
```

### Error Handling
- Network error recovery with retry mechanisms
- User-friendly error messages
- Offline state detection and handling
- Loading states for all async operations

### Performance Optimization
- Image lazy loading and caching
- Virtual lists for large datasets
- Memory management for navigation
- Bundle size optimization

## Testing Strategy

### Development Testing
- Expo Go for rapid iteration
- Multiple device sizes and orientations
- iOS and Android platform testing
- Network condition simulation

### Production Testing
- Standalone app builds
- Performance testing on low-end devices
- Battery usage optimization
- Memory leak detection

## Deployment Process

### Development Build
```bash
cd mobile
npm start
```

### Production Build
```bash
# Android
expo build:android

# iOS
expo build:ios
```

### App Store Submission
1. Build production apps
2. Test thoroughly on multiple devices
3. Prepare app store metadata
4. Submit to Apple App Store and Google Play Store
